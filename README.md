# Background
Research project centered around motivation in VR fitness applications.

The goal of the project is to shed light on the question: "What intrinsic motivational factor is most important?"

### Intrinsic motivational factors
- Autonomy
  - Feeling of control
- Competence
  - User ability
  - "How competent is the user?"
- Relatedness
  - Feeling part of a community
  - Leaderboard, multiplayer, etc.

### Final project and game idea
The final project will be a VR application dedicated to user testing. It will feature 4 different parts (one for each motivational factor from above), while the last will give the user the ability to choose to replay one of the 3.

The game will be based off of Beat Saber but for boxing ([Supernatual](https://www.getsupernatural.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAvoqsBhB9EiwA9XTWGWVEeRLK9L_vp2Ft8HprtH0cyfJ3X68DLpVEyN3WWjsqPos07pAdexoCqCcQAvD_BwE) & [FitXR](https://fitxr.com/))

# Developer Log

I worked on the abstract for the research paper, the game design of each version of the game, and implemented the initial game mechanics of the game.
## Abstract
### What is the background of the project/idea
Intrinsic motivation is crucial
Intrinsic motiviation has 3 components:
- Autonomy
- Competence
- Relatedness
All 3 components are good to have (GDT), but not always feasible to implement. Therefore, the goal of the project is to shed light on the question: "Which factor is most important?" or "Which factor has highest effect on users?".

### What is the motivation for the project/idea
The main issue with fitness VR applications is retaining users over time. Furhtermore, it is known that all 3 motivational factors are important, but they are not always feasible to implement in all games. Therefore, it is valuable to know how each component affect users' motivation when it comes to fitness VR applications.

### What is the concrete idea/project
The final project will be a VR application dedicated to user testing. It will feature 4 different parts (one for each motivational factor from above), while the last will give the user the ability to choose to replay one of the 3.

The game will be based off of Beat Saber but for boxing ([Supernatual](https://www.getsupernatural.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAvoqsBhB9EiwA9XTWGWVEeRLK9L_vp2Ft8HprtH0cyfJ3X68DLpVEyN3WWjsqPos07pAdexoCqCcQAvD_BwE) & [FitXR](https://fitxr.com/))

### What is the method you use
I will implement a fitness application that will put the user in different versions of a game, that each focus on their own factor of motivation. Once pilot testing is done, the user study will begin, where users will come and go through a somewhat guided use of the application, before answering a questionnaire about intrinsic motivation.

### What are the results of the project
Hopefully the results of the project is that one factor has a higher effect on motivation on users.

### What are the implications of the project
The results can help others to implement applications with higher motivational success.

## Game Design
### Autonomy

### Competence

### Relatedness

## Initial game mecahnics
